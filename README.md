# SI 364 - Fall 2018 - Final Project

## Application Description

My final project application employs IMDB’s API (OMDb). Users are able to search for movie and/or TV titles and see the following information associated with those titles:
- Rating
- Year Released
- Short version of the title’s plot
- Director

They are also able to give their own ranking for the movie. Moreover, the application allows users to create lists of their favorite movies and/or TV shows.
